# flashlate

Flashcard app with integrated translate function

## My Idea:

Creating a translate Application that combines translations, flashcards, overviews and konjugations.
All in one App

## The Main Page

![image](images/main_page_half.jpeg)

The user can directly click on the language field, he wants to choose, without unnecessarily switching the language and clicking on the text field again.

## The Practice Page

The user can train his memory skills and use one of the best memorization techniques to learn a new language.

## The List Page

The user gets an overview over all his practice decks. Here can decks be added and removed.

- Add the upstream branch from the original repo:
    - ``` git remote add upstream git@github.com:philipprobin/flashlate.git```

### The Usual Workflow anytime you want to commit

- Checkout to your branch and add features:
    - ``` git checkout own_branch_name ```
- Update your current fork to stay in sync with the original upstream, **Very Important!!**:
    - ``` git pull -r upstream main```
- Commit your changes:
    - ``` git status ```
    - ``` git add . ```
    - ``` git commit -m 'message' ```


### Push to the main repo

- Push your changes to the main repo:
    - ``` git push --set-upstream origin own_branch_name ```
- Open Pull Request
- The Owner merges the pull request.
